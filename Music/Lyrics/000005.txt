What's the trick? I wish I knew<br>
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been<br>
And I know you want me too<br>
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you<br>
You cross the line and it's time to say F you<br>
What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?<br>
You think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that<br>
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad<br>
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that<br>
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever<br>
When it don't work out for the better<br>
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye<br>
When it all falls down, when it all falls down<br>
I'll be fine<br>
I'll be fine<br>
You're the drug that I'm addicted to<br>
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine<br>
Why we fight? I don't know<br>
We say what hurts the most<br>
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal<br>
All these firing shots and making ground<br>
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go<br>
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever<br>
When it don't work out for the better<br>
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye<br>
When it all falls down, when it all falls down<br>
I'll be fine<br>
I'll be fine<br>
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad<br>
But I'll be fine<br>
I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
I'll be fine, fine, fine<br>
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine<br>
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever (then whatever, babe)<br>
When it don't work out for the better (for the better)<br>
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye<br>
When it all falls down (when it all, when it all)<br>
When it all falls down (when it all falls down)<br>
I'll be fine<br>
(Fine, fine, fine) I'll be fine (I'll be fine)<br>
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad<br>
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that<br>
