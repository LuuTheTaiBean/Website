You turn over the hour glass<br>
The sand is falling down<br>
Oh, it's too fast for you<br>
For you<br>
Don't waste your love, just let it last<br>
'Cause once it's gone it's never coming back<br>
It's true<br>
Could you love me the same?<br>
Tell me what makes you stay<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a lover<br>
Hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
I won't wait a minute longer<br>
Hundred ways to leave<br>
But I'm the only one that you need<br>
It's the final curtain call<br>
But if you're ready I will give my all<br>
For you, for you<br>
Let them say it how they want<br>
If I can love you good, it's no one's fault<br>
Ooh<br>
Could you love me the same?<br>
Tell me what makes you stay<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a lover<br>
Hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
I won't wait a minute longer<br>
Hundred ways to leave<br>
But I'm the only one that you need<br>
I'm the only one that you need<br>
I'm the only one that you need<br>
I'm the only one that you need<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a lover<br>
Hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
Leave a lover, leave a<br>
There's a hundred ways to leave a lover<br>
I won't wait a minute longer<br>
Hundred ways to leave<br>
But I'm the only one that you need<br>
I'm the only one that you need<br>
I'm the only one that you need<br>
