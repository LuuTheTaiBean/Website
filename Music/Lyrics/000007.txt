I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care<br>
But it's so cold and I don't know where<br>
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string<br>
But they won't flower like they did last spring<br>
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright<br>
I'm just so tired to share my nights<br>
I wanna cry and I wanna love<br>
But all my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up, up<br>
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight<br>
But my hand's been broken one too many times<br>
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude<br>
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose<br>
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours<br>
But I sang 'em all to another heart<br>
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love<br>
But all my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up, up<br>
Oh, need a love, now<br>
My heart is thinking of<br>
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours<br>
But I sang 'em all to another heart<br>
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love<br>
But all my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up<br>
On another love, another love<br>
All my tears have been used up, up<br>
