Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must have been something you said<br> 
I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
I keep lookin' for somethin' I can't get<br> 
Broken hearts lie all around me<br> 
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this<br> 
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table<br> 
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle<br> 
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this<br>
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been something you said<br> 
I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been some kind of kiss<br> 
I should've walked away<br> 
I should've walked away<br> 
Is there any just cause for feelin' like this?<br> 
On the surface, I'm a name on a list<br> 
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again<br> 
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake<br> 
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take<br> 
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times<br> 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been something you said<br> 
I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been some kind of kiss<br> 
I should've walked away<br> 
I should've walked away<br> 
It was a long hot night<br> 
She made it easy, she made it feel right<br> 
But now it's over, the moment has gone<br> 
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong<br> 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been something you said<br> 
I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
I, I just died in your arms tonight<br> 
It must've been some kind of kiss<br> 
I should've walked away<br> 
I should've walked away<br>
